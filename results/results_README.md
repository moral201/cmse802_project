# Results (`results/`)

This folder contains animation videos generated during the development of the body/fluid simulation project.

## Files

- `final_implementation.mp4`  
  Final integrated simulation showing the complete reactive stepping body with arm control and realistic fluid-body interactions. This is the most up-to-date and complete version.

- `reactive_stepping.mp4`  
  Early animation from HW2 showcasing the reactive stepping controller without arms or fluid interaction.

- `fluid.mp4`  
  Demonstration of the standalone fluid particle system before integration into the full-body model.

## Notes

- The earlier animations (`reactive_stepping.mp4`, `fluid.mp4`) were used during Homework 2 to validate individual subsystems.
- These components were later refined and combined into the final integrated simulation presented in `final_implementation.mp4`.
