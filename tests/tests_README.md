# Unit Tests (`tests/`)

This folder contains unit tests for key functions in the simulation project.

## Files

- `unittest_physics_utils.py`  
  Contains unit tests for functions in `physics_utils.py`, including:
  - Torque computation
  - Segment dynamics update
  - Particle reflection from body segments

## Notes

- These tests help verify the correctness of physics-related logic in the simulation.
- The tests can be run independently using any Python test runner (e.g., `pytest`, `unittest` CLI).
